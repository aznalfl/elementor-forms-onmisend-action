# Elementor Forms to Omnisend Action

This is a custom WordPress plugin for Elementor forms that allows form submissions to be sent to Omnisend.

## Description

This plugin extends the Elementor Pro Form widget by adding a new action after submit to integrate with Omnisend. Submitted form data can be sent to an Omnisend account as new or updated contacts, allowing users to manage their subscribers through Omnisend.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin files.
2. Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

## Usage

Once installed and activated, you can use the plugin by doing the following:

1. Create a new form with the Elementor Pro Form widget.
2. In the form settings, under the "Actions After Submit" section, select "Omnisend".
3. In the new "Omnisend" section that appears, you'll be able to map your form fields to Omnisend contact fields. Input your Omnisend API Key here and set other options as required.
